Problem 1: Number representation
Put your answers to the following questions in hw0.txt

Assume we are dealing with 8 bit numbers for this problem. Complete the following tables to practice encoding decimal values into unsigned and two's complement. The first table is unsigned and the second table is two's complement. The first row of each column has been filled out for you.

If a decimal number can't be encoded into binary and hexadecimal with the given scheme, write "n/a" for both columns.
Note: The '0b' and '0x' prefixes denote the following numeral as binary or hexadecimal respectively.

Unsigned
Decimal	binary		Hexadecimal
10		0b0000 1010	0x0A
240		0b1111 0000	0xF0
15		0b0000 1111	0x0F
161		0b1010 0001	0xA1
250		0b1111 0001	0xF1
255		0b1111 1111	0xFF
204		0b1100 1100 0xCC
-35		n/a 		n/a
128		0b1000 0000	0x80
105		0b0110 1001	0x69

Two's Complement
Decimal	Binary		Hexadecimal
-10		0b1111 0110	0xF6
-16		0b1111 0000	0xF0
15		0b0000 1111	0x0F
-95		0b1010 0001	0xA1
250		n/a 		n/a
-1		0b1111 1111	0xFF
-52		0b1100 1100	0xCC
-35		0b1101 1101	0xDD
128		n/a 		n/a
105		0b0110 1001	0x


Problem 2: Picking representations
Put your answers to the following questions in hw0.txt

Assume we are working with 8-bit numbers for the entirety of this question.

For each part below, you will be given a choice between unsigned and two's complement. It's your job to pick the better number representation for the given criteria, or denote that both representations are equally good. Explain your answer in one sentence or less.:
1. You would like to represent the temperature in degrees Celsius:

   UNSIGNED   or   TWO'S COMPLEMENT   or BOTH

TWO'COMPLEMENT, Celsius includes negative degrees.


2. You would like to maximize the range (distance between most negative represented number, and most positive represented number):

   UNSIGNED   or   TWO'S COMPLEMENT   or BOTH

UNSIGNED, range is a positive number, unsigned number could cover bigger distance.


3. You would like to represent the number of boxes a factory has shipped:

   UNSIGNED   or   TWO'S COMPLEMENT   or BOTH

UNSIGNED, the same reason above.

Problem 3: Counting
Put your answers to the following questions in hw0.txt

a. For a system of n-digit unsigned base 4 numbers (n > 1), how many numbers can be represented?
4^n

b. For an n-digit 2's complement binary number (n > 1), what is the number of negative integers?
2^(n-1)

c. For an n-digit 2's complement number (n > 1), how many zeros are there?
1

d. For an n-digit 2's complement number (n > 1), what is the difference between the most positive number and the most negative number?
2^n - 1

Problem 4: Overflow
The following addition and subtraction operations are to be carried out with 8-bit 2's complement numbers. For each operation, calculate the result and label as OVERFLOW or CORRECT

Example: 1 + 2 = 0b0000 0001 + 0b0000 0010 = 0b0000 0011 = 3, CORRECT

64 + 64 = 0b0100 0000 + 0b0100 0000 = 0b1000 0000 = -128, OVERFLOW
-127 + 30 = 0b1000 0001 + 0b0001 1110 = 0b1001 1111 = -97, CORRECT
-127 - 1 = 0b1000 0001 - 0b0000 0001 = 0b1000 0000 = -128, CORRECT
38 - 40 = 0b0010 0110 - 0b0010 1000 = 0b1111 1110 = -2, CORRECT
